## Installation

### Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MurleePatil/clinicals.git
cd clinicals
```

### Set Up the Database

Ensure you have MySQL installed and running on your system. You can download it from [MySQLâ€™s official site](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/).

Next, create a database for the application in MySQL:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE clinicalsdb;
```

### Configure the Database in Django

In your `settings.py` file (found in the `clinicals` directory), configure the database settings to use MySQL. Locate the `DATABASES` setting and modify it to match your MySQL credentials:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'clinicalsdb',  # Name of the database you created
        'USER': 'your_mysql_user',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_mysql_password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '3306',
    }
}
```

### Apply Migrations

Run the following command to set up the database tables:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### Run the Development Server

Start the development server with the following command:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
